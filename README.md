------------

Puissance 4 is a game where each player must align 4 same symbols (**O** or **X**). The goal of this repository is to develop an AI able to play against a human with a good level. Moreover, contrary to the classical Puissance4, we have here a grid of *6 x 12*.

# Requirements

- numpy
- random
- time

# Installation

You can just launch a shell and execute the following command:


~~~
~ python PuissanceUltra

You will have to choose the first player (you or the AI).   The AI have the **X** symbol and you have the **O**.
